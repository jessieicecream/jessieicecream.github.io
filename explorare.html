        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
            Explorare is a reading program where students will read and discuss classical texts through approximately 4 online sessions and will work in-person on a final project for 2 days. Expected topics range from humanities (philosophy, literature, etc.) and pure sciences (mathematics, physics, etc.). There will be one topic for each round. The first round is held in Shanghai.
